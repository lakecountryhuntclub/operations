## Overview

Small business insurance gives your business financial protection when there are liability claims such as property damage or bodily injury, or from accusations that you made errors and omissions in your professional services.

The physical property of a business can be covered as well, such as inventory. And with hacking on the rise, cyber liability insurance is important to pay for the recovery costs if your business computer network gets attacked by thieves.

The vast majority of small businesses would suffer financially if they were sued or experienced a devastating loss, such as losing inventory in a fire. For those businesses, commercial insurance is a must.

Without small business insurance, you’d have to pay for the legal costs of lawsuits and find a way to pay for damage to your business property. General liability insurance and commercial property insurance are good places to start. Commercial auto is important if you have cars, trucks or vans that you use for business. 

And workers compensation insurance is required in most states.

A good place to start is with a [business owners policy (BOP)](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/business-owners-policy/). It bundles three essential coverage types: general liability insurance, commercial property insurance and business interruption insurance. Combined, these three policies cover problems like accidental injuries and property damage, reputational harm, damaged or stolen business property, and income replacement if you can’t open your business due to a problem covered by your policy.

But a BOP alone may not cover all your needs. You may need to buy other [types of small business insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/types-of-small-business-insurance/#commercial-auto-insurance) to cover the risks that affect your company. For example, if you have a work vehicle, a BOP won’t pay for repairs if you get into a car accident. You’ll need to add commercial auto insurance. It’s a good idea to speak with your insurance agent to make sure your business insurance policy meets the specific demands of your industry.

        -   Businesses that are seasonal or limited in duration.

## LLC Small Business Insurance

LLC small business insurance refers to coverage types designed to protect business assets. For example, an essential business insurance coverage type is liability insurance. This covers your LLC for problems like accidental property damage and injuries caused to others, such as a customer who trips and falls while shopping in your store.

You can choose between several different small business coverage types. Pick the coverages that best suit your LLC’s needs. For example, if you use a car for business purposes, you can buy a commercial auto insurance policy.

Even with an LLC, [small business insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/best-small-business-insurance/) is important to have. This is because your LLC structure only protects your personal assets from lawsuits. It leaves your business assets completely exposed—unless you have LLC small business insurance.

### LLC Insurance Considerations

It's a good idea to get [business insurance for your LLC](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/llc-need-small-business-insurance/). That’s because business insurance covers your business assets. For example, if someone slips in your store and gets injured, general liability insurance can pay for medical bills as well as legal costs if you get sued because of the accident.

While business insurance is essential for high-risk industries, such as manufacturing and construction, it’s also a good idea if you’re in a lower-risk industry, such as freelancing or bookkeeping. For example, if you get hit with a copyright infringement claim for one of your digital ads, your general liability insurance can cover your legal costs.

If you’ve already set your business up as a limited liability company (LLC), you may be wondering if that’s enough. After all, an LLC separates your personal assets from your business ones. Do you really need to go the extra mile and get LLC insurance too?

Business insurance is a smart buy. Some types of coverage are essential for all businesses—whether you’re a solopreneur with a budding freelance business or the CEO of a construction company. Here’s a closer look at why your LLC might need business insurance (regardless of its size), along with the most common coverage types.

#### Do You Need LLC Small Business Insurance?

In some high-risk industries, like agriculture, construction and manufacturing, LLC small business insurance is a must-buy. But even in low-risk industries like freelancing, bookkeeping and home-based businesses, LLC insurance is still highly encouraged. The three most common insurance needs that all businesses have are general liability insurance, commercial property insurance and workers compensation insurance.

The future is full of unknowns, and you never know when a thief may steal your laptop, an artist may sue you for copyright infringement or a client may take you to court for breaching a service contract.

“Many businesses operate for years without being sued, but if you are sued, the payments requested by attorneys can be catastrophic,” says Nelson.

Think of it like this: If you don’t have the money to replace expensive equipment or fight a lengthy court battle, you need some type of LLC small business insurance—even if it’s just a professional or general liability policy.

#### What’s Covered by LLC Small Business Insurance?

At its core, LLC small business insurance protects your business from financial losses in the event of an accident. What’s covered will depend on the coverage types you buy.

Here are some of the main [types of small business insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/types-of-small-business-insurance/).

#### How Much Does LLC Small Business Insurance Cost?

A business owners policy costs $57 per month on average, with 12% of business owners paying less than $33 per month, according to Insureon.

Your LLC small business insurance costs will vary depending on factors such as:

-   Your type of business
-   The size of your business
-   Location of your business
-   Number of employees
-   Payroll
-   Business assets
-   The years of experience of your business
-   The amount of coverage you buy
-   Your insurance deductible amount
-   Your insurance claims history

### Business Owners Policy for LLCs

Think of a [business owners policy](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/business-owners-policy/) (BOP) as a bundled insurance package for small businesses. It can be a great fit for LLCs because it covers some of the most common risks you may face, including property damage and liability.

BOPs typically come bundled with these three policies:

-   **General liability insurance**. This covers accidental injuries and property damage to others. [General liability insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/general-liability-coverage/) also pays for legal costs, judgments and settlements if you’re sued.

“If your LLC has vendors or customers—or if you lease or own property—general liability insurance is highly recommended,” says Dana Beck, Chief Underwriting Officer, Small Commercial, at Travelers. “In fact, vendors and landlords often require it.” But there are [differences between a standalone general liability insurance and business owners policy](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/general-liability-vs-business-owners-policy/).

-   **Commercial property insurance**. As an LLC, you likely have some business property, whether it’s office furniture, equipment or inventory. If that property is damaged or destroyed by a problem covered by your policy (like a fire), [commercial property insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/commercial-property-insurance/) can help you repair or replace it.
-   **Business interruption insurance**. This coverage can help your LLC stay afloat if you have to temporarily close your doors due to a problem covered by your policy. For example, say a severe storm damages your office, and you must close for two weeks while repairs are made. [Business interruption insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/business-interruption-insurance/) can help cover the cost of rent at a temporary location, employee salaries and other necessary expenses.

### Other types of business insurance for LLCs

BOPs are a great starting point, but they aren’t the only type of business insurance your LLC may need. In addition to a BOP, you may want to consider one or more of these coverage types, depending on your situation:

-   **Commercial auto insurance**. Your personal car insurance policy most likely excludes coverage for business use. This means you’ll need to purchase [commercial auto insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/best-commercial-auto-insurance-companies/) if you or your employees use your vehicle for work-related purposes.
-   **Workers compensation insurance**. If you have at least one employee, you’re required to have [workers compensation insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/workers-compensation-insurance/) in most states. This type of insurance can help you cover the cost of medical bills, lost wages and other expenses associated with workplace injuries or illnesses.
-   **Professional liability insurance**. Also known as [errors and omissions insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/errors-and-omissions/), this type of policy is vital for any LLC that provides professional services, such as consulting, accounting or financial planning. It helps cover the cost of claims against professional mistakes.

“Even if you’re doing everything right, people make mistakes,” says Paige Nelson, Director of Product Development at Acuity Insurance. “If you’re a contractor and install the wrong flooring, it didn’t cause any damage, but it still needs to be replaced. This coverage would pay for that error.”

-   **Product liability insurance**. If your LLC manufactures, creates, distributes or sells physical products, then [product liability insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/product-liability-insurance/) is a good coverage type to have. It can help you cover the cost of litigation if your products cause property damage or injuries to someone else.

### How Do I Get LLC Small Business Insurance?

You can find [cheap small business insurance](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/cheap-business-insurance/#:~:text=How Much Does Small Business,per year%2C according to Insureon.) for your LLC in a few steps:

-   **Determine how much coverage you need**. A business owners policy is a good place to start. Then you can add additional coverage types as necessary.
-   **Shop around**. Compare business insurance quotes from multiple insurance companies. You can shop online or speak with an independent insurance agent who specializes in small business insurance.
-   **Bundle policies**. You may need several different coverage types to cover your LLC’s bases. You’ll typically save money by purchasing multiple policies from the same insurance company.
-   **Manage your LLC’s risk**. You may be able to get discounts if you take steps to mitigate your LLC’s risks, such as installing security alarms, creating a safe workspace, reducing your exposure to cyber threats and developing an employee handbook.

To get the most accurate small business insurance quotes, make sure you have all your LLC information ready, such as:

-   Your contact information
-   Your business location, address and details
-   The type of business you operate
-   Your estimated business revenue
-   How many employees you have

Once your policy is in place, consider reassessing your risk at least once a year or anytime your business liabilities change. For example, expanding the types of services you offer, moving to a new location or hiring more employees could mean you need to add more coverage to your policy.

## Business Owners Policy (BOP)

A [business owners policy (BOP)](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-insurance/business-owners-policy/) is an affordable way to get essential coverage for a small business. General liability insurance, commercial property insurance and business interruption insurance are all included in a BOP.

Small business owners who can’t afford to pay out of pocket for legal costs if they’re sued or to repair or replace their physical assets if lost, damaged or stolen can benefit from a business owners policy. Businesses with these characteristics are good candidates for BOP insurance:

-   A business that operates in a physical location, such as a home-based business or in a store or office space.
-   A business that has assets that can be stolen, such as products, cash, computers, inventory and business furniture.
-   A business that is at high risk for a lawsuit.
-   A business that has less than 100 employees and less than $5 million in sales.
-   A business located in an area that is prone to severe weather conditions, like hurricanes.

Here are some types of small businesses that are good candidates for a BOP:

-   Manufacturers
-   Religious organizations
-   Restaurants
-   Retailers
-   Technology consultants
-   Wholesalers

### How Much Does a Business Owners Policy Cost?

**A business owners policy costs an average of $57 per month**, according to Insureon.

The cost of your BOP will vary based on factors such as:

-   **Your industry.** Industries that have higher risks, such as construction companies, typically pay more for coverage than lower-risk industries.
-   **Your business location.** A business located in an area with higher crime and regions prone to severe weather may pay more than other businesses.
-   **Number of employees.** If you have a large number of employees, you can expect to pay more for business insurance.
-   **Property value.** A business’ property value plays a role in business insurance costs.
-   **The amount of coverage you purchase.** How much coverage you buy affects your rates, since the insurance company is offering a higher level of coverage.
-   **The amount of the insurance deductible.** The deductible is how much your insurance company reduces from your claims payment. A lower deductible typically results in higher business insurance premiums.
-   **Claims history.** Companies that have a recent history of filing business insurance claims are considered a higher risk to file more claims in the future and typically pay more compared to a company with no recent business insurance claims.

A business owners policy is often more affordable than buying separate policies for liability, property and business interruption.

### How To Decrease the Cost of BOP Insurance Rates

**The average business owners policy costs $684 annually**, according to Insureon. But you may find a policy under $600 a year. Insureon estimates that 42% of its small business customers pay under $600 for coverage each year.

There are ways to save on BOP insurance, including:

-   **Pay for the full year**. Insurance companies often provide a discount if you pay for a full year’s coverage rather than monthly or quarterly.
-   **Choose a higher deductible.** A BOP insurance’s deductible influences how much you pay for coverage. You can save by choosing a higher deductible, but remember that you will also get less from the insurance company if you file a claim since the deductible amount is deducted from a claim payment.
-   **Get only coverage that you need.** Small business insurance companies have many types of coverage, but your business might not need many of them. BOP insurance typically has many add-ons, but only choose coverage types that your business actually needs. For example, if your business doesn’t serve alcohol, you wouldn’t need liquor liability insurance.

### Is Your Small Business Eligible For a Business Owners Policy?

Insurance companies look at a number of factors when determining if a business is eligible for a BOP: type of business, size of its primary location and revenue.

Business Insurance companies also consider the financial stability of the business, building construction, security features and fire hazards.

If you pass all these factors, you will be able to get a BOP.

### How to Get the Best Business Owners Policy

A business owners policy is a solid foundation for your small business, but to get the best business owners policy for your company, you’ll want to customize your BOP to meet the specific risks that are common to your industry.

-   **Assess your business’s risk.** The risks that your small business face are unique to your industry. You can add coverage types to your BOP to customize your policy to fit your company’s specific needs. For example, if your company handles sensitive customer information like health records and Social Security numbers, you may want to add cyber liability insurance to your BOP.
-   **Reassess your risks annually.** As your business grows, your liabilities might change. For example, if you hired more employees or expanded the types of services you offer. It’s a good idea to reassess your risks yearly and speak with your insurance agent if you need more coverage.
-   **Shop around.** Insurers don’t price their policies the same so make sure you compare small business insurance quotes from multiple insurance companies. You can typically get free quotes online or by speaking with an independent insurance agent.
