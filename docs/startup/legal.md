>   Most businesses need a lawyer at some point, particularly when theyâ€™re just starting out. Hiring an independent business attorney to handle all your legal needs can be cost-prohibitive, especially for those launching a new company on a budget. The good news is that many business legal matters, including business formation, can be handled via trustworthy online legal service providers.

The best online legal services offer a timely and affordable way to set up your limited liability company (LLC), corporation or nonprofit while also ensuring you remain compliant with filing rules and regulations. You can also use an online legal service provider to help you file your employer identification number (EIN), create legal partnerships, draft business contacts and protect your intellectual property through trademarks and copyrights. Some companies even offer live consultations with licensed attorneys.

Filing and registering an LLC with any given state does not require an attorney. For more complicated business structures and those who want to ensure no mistakes are made, hiring a lawyer may be advisable. Generally, forming an LLC does not specifically require hiring a lawyer.

All states require that those forming an LLC assign a registered agent to their new business. You can serve as your own registered agent, but many people prefer to assign registered agent responsibilities to an online legal service provider.

A registered agent is a company or person that receives government correspondence, legal documents and tax forms on behalf of your business. A registered agent can help your company remain compliant by keeping you notified of legal notices and alerting you to upcoming annual report filing deadlines. Many online legal service providers offer registered agent services.
